      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <div id="privacy-tab">
        <p>Effective date: <strong>November 29, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>Short summary</h2>
        <p>
          RBX Calculators ("we", "the site") is built with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> automatically collect personal
          data. Most settings and form values are stored locally in your browser (<code>localStorage</code>). Optional analytics
          or advertising services are activated only after you give explicit consent. Below are region-specific details for
          European regulations (GDPR) and major U.S. state privacy laws.
        </p>

        <h2>What data we may handle</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hosting logs:</strong> Minimal technical logs kept by the hosting provider (e.g., Netlify) such as request
            timestamps and IPs. These are hosting-level and not used for personalization inside RBXC.</li>
          <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> UI preferences, form values, selected theme and settings persisted in <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
          <li><strong>User-submitted data:</strong> Any information you voluntarily post to GitHub, Discord, or other public channels.
            Those are governed by the recipient service's policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies, advertising & consent (EEA, UK, Switzerland)</h2>
        <p>
          For visitors located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we obtain explicit consent
          before setting any cookies or loading third‑party advertising or analytics scripts that are not strictly necessary.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Serving personalised or third-party ads to visitors from the EEA/UK/CH requires active consent.
            If you are shown ads, consent controls will appear in the cookie banner and in <strong>Settings → Allow Cookies</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookie banner:</strong> The site displays a cookie banner to users in those regions explaining what categories
            (necessary, preferences, analytics, advertising) are used and allowing granular choices.</li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> You can withdraw or change your choices at any time using the cookie banner link or via
            <strong>Settings → Allow Cookies</strong>. If consent is withdrawn, advertising/analytics scripts will be disabled for
            future page loads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legal basis for processing (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
          When we process personal data of individuals in the EEA/UK/CH, we do so only when we have a lawful basis, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consent</strong> — for cookies, analytics, or advertising where required.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — limited technical processing necessary to operate and secure the site (minimal
            hosting logs), balanced against user privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rights of EU/UK/Swiss residents</h2>
        <p>
          If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have rights under applicable data protection laws, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The right to access personal data we hold about you.</li>
          <li>The right to rectification of inaccurate data.</li>
          <li>The right to erasure (delete) where we control the data.</li>
          <li>The right to restrict or object to processing.</li>
          <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time (without affecting processing based on consent before withdrawal).</li>
          <li>The right to data portability, where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To exercise these rights, contact us via the links in the <strong>Contact</strong> section below. Note that data you post
          publicly on third-party services (e.g., GitHub issues) is subject to those platforms' policies and may remain visible
          there even if you request removal from RBXC.
        </p>

        <h2>US state privacy laws (California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and other states)</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to provide transparency and controls for visitors who are subject to U.S. state privacy laws (for example, California
          Consumer Privacy Act / CPRA, Virginia CDPA, Colorado CPA, Connecticut UCPA). If you are a resident of a U.S. state with a
          privacy law that gives you specific rights, you may have rights similar to the EU rights above, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right to know what categories of personal data we collect and why.</li>
          <li>Right to access and request deletion of personal data we control.</li>
          <li>Right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal data (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          RBXC does not "sell" personal data. To manage state-specific notices and settings we provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>State privacy notice:</strong> If we detect or are informed that a visitor is from a state with specific
            disclosure requirements, we will present a short notice explaining applicable rights and how to exercise them.</li>
          <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Users can manage consent and preference toggles via <strong>Settings → Allow Cookies</strong> and
            through the cookie banner. For data access or deletion requests, contact us using the Contact links below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to exercise your rights</h2>
        <p>
          For all regions, the simplest way to exercise your rights (access, deletion, objection, withdraw consent) is to contact us
          via the project repository or Discord. Provide enough detail to locate the data and we will respond promptly within any
          legally required timeframes.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We apply reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data processed by the site. As a primarily static
          front-end application with local storage, centralised data collection is minimised. Nonetheless, no system is perfectly
          secure — avoid sharing sensitive personal information in public channels.
        </p>

        <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data stored in your browser (localStorage) remains on your device until you clear it or delete browser data.</li>
          <li>If you enable third-party services (analytics or ads), those providers may retain data according to their policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          The site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child
          has provided personal data, contact us and we will take reasonable steps to remove that data.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. When material changes are made, the effective date at the top will be updated
          and the revised policy posted here.
        </p>
